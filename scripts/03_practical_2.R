###Questions to answer in the report
##How many times has Insula colonised the Caribbean islands?
# Only once. Look at the tree on GitHub and see in which clades there is mainland included. That is the case nowhere, only the outgroup is mainland. That makes that there is just 1 colonization.

##How many times has Insula colonised Jamaica?
#There have been 5 colonizations. Count in the tree made in R.

##How many radiations have occurred on Jamaica?
#There have been 2 radiations. There are 2 clades with recent cladogenesis.

##What are the rates of colonisation, speciation and extinction for Insula in Jamaica?
#The outcomes have been taken from model 3 as that was found as the best model via AIC
#Colonization = gamma = 0.02762404
#Speciation = lambda_c = 6.76418
#Speciation = lambda_a = 0
#Extinction = mu = 8.775854

##Is there evidence for diversity-dependence in the Insula species of Jamaica?
#No, there is no evidence for diversity dependence. Diversity dependence is indicated by the carrying capacity K and that variable is infinite in the best model (M3).

##Is there evidence for equilibrium dynamics on the island of Jamaica?
#Yes, there is evidence since the number of species over time is stable in the simulation. A plateau is shown in the graph for both the endemic and non-endemic species. The dynamics consist of speciation and extinction and if the the number of species is stable, the dynamics are in equilibrium.

##How has the diversity of Insula on Jamaica changed through time (according to DAISIE simulations)?
#The diversity of Insula on Jamaica showed a very quick increase in the first 1 million years, after which the endemic diversity stabilizes around 10 species. The diversity of the non-endemic species is stable around 3 species.

##Modify one or two parameters of your choice and run simulations again under those parameters. How does this affect the simulations? Describe.
#Option 1: low colonization / regular extinction -> equilibrium
#Option 2: high colonization / low extinction -> increase in diversity
#Option 3: low colonization / high extinction -> decrease in diversity
#Base the answer on the outcomes of these 3 simulations shown at the bottom of this script.
